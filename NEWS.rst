News for Gauge
==============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list of
every change, see the Git log.

Latest
------
* tbd
* Minor: Add the prepare_table(...) function to allow benchmarks to create
  their needed result columns in advance. The allocation of new columns during
  the benchmark can disrupt the performance measurements.

11.1.2
------
* Patch: Reserve runs in result table.

11.1.1
------
* Patch: Added virtual constructor to printer.

11.1.0
------
* Minor: Added a CPU warm-up time before starting first benchmark to avoid
  unfavorable results for the first few benchmarks. The time interval can
  be controlled by the ``--warmup_time`` option.

11.0.0
------
* Major: Upgrade to waf-tools 4
* Major: Upgrade to boost 3
* Major: Upgrade to tables 7
* Minor: Upgrade to gtest 4

10.0.0
------
* Major: Upgrade to waf-tools 3
* Major: Upgrade to boost 2
* Major: Upgrade to tables 6
* Minor: Upgrade to gtest 3
* Minor: Added buildbot.py for coverage reports.

9.1.0
-----
* Minor: Adding a way to skip a benchmark at run-time. An example use-case
  for this is benchmarking run-time dispatched CPU specific instructions
  e.g. SSE, AVX etc.

9.0.1
-----
* Patch: Fixed warnings in using_options.cpp.
* Patch: Added the proper use flags for all targets

9.0.0
-----
* Major: Updated the benchmark macros. There are now three variants to
  choose from when declaring a benchmark. This introduced one breaking
  change: The BENCHMARK_F macro has been renamed to BENCHMARK_F_INLINE. You
  should now use BENCHMARK_F if your fixture has a test_body() function that
  you want to run automatically. See gauge.hpp for a description of the
  different macros.
* Patch: Fix version define.

8.0.0
-----
* Major: Upgrade to tables 5.x.y
* Major: Made single argument constructors explicit
* Minor: Fixed style issues
* Minor: Update to waf 1.8.0-pre1
* Minor: Made python files comply with pep8
* Minor: Added command line options to print testcases and benchmarks.
* Minor: Added version.

7.1.0
-----
* Minor: Added newlines to the ``stdout_printer``'s output.

7.0.0
-----
* Major: Removed unused ``commandline_arguments`` class.
* Major: Removed vector separator options form ``csv_printer`` as it was unused.
* Minor: Added ``dry_run`` option to execute the benchmark initialization code
  without running the actual benchmark.
* Minor: Added ``use_[printer_name]`` option to enable or disable certain
  printers.
* Minor: Added ``stdout_printer`` which is a printer that can print results
  in a specified format to standard output.
* Bug: If an exception occurred, gauge now returns an appropriate error code.

6.3.0
-----
* Minor: Added a convenience function add_default_printers() to the
  gauge runner. This enables most common printers in a project.

6.2.0
-----
* Minor: runner::run now catches all exceptions. The API has been
  extended with runner::run_unsafe which doesn't catch exceptions.

6.1.0
-----
* Bug: Removed configuration information from the result table.
* Minor: Improved filter options for benchmark testing purposes.

6.0.0
-----
* Major: Started using tables version 4.
* Major: Extracted tables and related logic to its own repository.

5.5.0
-----
* Minor: The python- and CSV-printers can now take the default output filename
  as a parameter.

5.4.0
-----
* Minor: Eased use of python output file.

5.3.0
-----
* Minor: Improved filtering options for filtering benchmarks and results.

5.2.1
-----
* Bug: Fix file printers so that they correctly detect the end of all
  benchmarks.

5.2.0
-----
* Minor: Adding time-stamping to the console printer to give an overview of the
  time spent in every step.
* Minor: Added the option to control the CSV printer's value separator, the
  default is comma however this can now be changed command-line.

5.1.0
-----
* Minor: Cleanup

5.0.0
-----
* Minor: Update waf to version 1.7.10 and use the wurf_install_path tool.
* Minor: Updated to waf-tools version 2.x.y
* Minor: Added CSV (comma separated values) printer.
* Major: Changed the benchmark interface. Implementers of new benchmarks may
  now register several measurement results in a single run. The new benchmark
  also supports specifying custom benchmark options (available on the
  command-line).
* Minor: The benchmark fixtures are now only allocated when needed and destroyed
  after completing a benchmark. This releases resources allocated by previous
  benchmarks.
* Minor: Added a number of unit-test for testing gauge itself.

4.0.0
-----
* Updated waf to use new external waf tools repository

3.0.0
-----
* Switched to mkspec enabled builds

2.0.0
-----
* Using .hpp extension instead of .h

1.0.0
